[Moonlight Games](https://moonlight.silvereen.net) is a Game Site I have done Front-End and Back-End work on it offers fast cloud gaming and a healthy forum community and search proxy
#### When I Started
I started working on this project when a personal friend told me about his website called Silvereen Games. He wanted it to be a Mobile and Desktop game site. I said I can take a look at it and it was looking bland and lacked features. Thats when he invited me to work on a rebrand called Moonlight Games. Now 2 years later it is currently on **Moonlight 3.0** with a Moonlight 4.0 coming soon!
